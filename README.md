# tree
A selfhosted yggdrasil server made for Pyramid Launcher: nothing goes out of your computer!
database is in `youruserfolder/.pyramidmc/database/tree.db`

# props to

- [winter's yggdrasil server on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/winter/yggdrasil-server/src/branch/main) - An actual yggdrasil server made on Javascript and not on Python (I hate python)
- [wiki.vg's article on Legacy Mojang Authentication](https://wiki.vg/Legacy_Mojang_Authentication) - The documentation I read to know how the server worked
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - An SQL ORM with type declaration just so my SQLite experience was more... bearable.

# known issues

- requestUser doesn't work
